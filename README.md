# How To Get Good
This is an early class project of mine from university. The project builds a decision tree to make predictions on a given CSV dataset. Being that this project is for learning purposes, it is less than perfect. It's been a while since I executed this script and unfortunately, it suffers infinite recursion that I do not recall being present when I presented the project. This bug causes a stack overflow error. You can try running the script, but for now, it's better to just examine the code to see how the decision tree is built and executed. Once I have some time, I will update this project to be more efficient and to remove the bugs.

Using a terminal,

1. Download the project into a directory of your choice
    - `git clone https://github.com/JeffMII/How-To-Get-Good.git`

2. Open the cloned project's root directory and create an input subdirectory:
    - `mkdir input`

2. Download the dataset into the subdirectory (or use your own)
    - [UC Irvine - Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance)

2. Back inside the project's root directory, run the python script
    - `python3 how-to-get-good.py`

3. Follow the prompts in the terminal.
